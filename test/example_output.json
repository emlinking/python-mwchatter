You should be able to make a request if wanted, but my suggestion would be prepare a draft of what you want to say first. You could create [[User:New User Person/sandbox]] which is your standard sandbox with points that you intend to raise. However, if it concerns any aspect of [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], please review the [[WP:ARB911|previous case]] first. The first few paragraphs there have links to the evidence, workshop, and proposed decision pages. The findings there seem innocuous and might be hard for a new editor to interpret since they appear to say nothing more than the obvious fact that everyone should be nice. However, that is standard wording, and what it really means is that people do not have to repeat old arguments\u2014instead, a quick consensus can agree on whether a proposed change is desirable, and anyone attempting to override established procedures would be subject to sanctions. The discussion at [[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)#This page (9/11 conspiracy theories) violates the Wikipedia Five Pillars]] will not lead to anything because there is no actionable proposal that I can see. Instead, if some change were wanted, say at [[9/11 conspiracy theories]], a proposal should be made at its talk page. Disagreements about sources are discussed at [[WP:RSN]], and disagreements about what is neutral are discussed at [[WP:NPOVN]]. Question about the treatment of something claimed to be a conspiracy theory should be at [[WP:FTN]]. [[User:Johnuniq|Johnuniq]] ([[User talk:Johnuniq|talk]]) 03:42, 26 September 2015 (UTC)\n"

I took his advise, deciding to steer clear of any controversial articles until I felt I was ready, and had an ample understanding of Wikipedia\u007fUNIQ--nowiki-00000014-QINU\u007f2\u007fUNIQ--nowiki-00000015-QINU\u007f. I have tried to debate with editors over five years ago as an anonymous IP, which is why I am familiar with a few of the editors, and the process of Wikipedia. I don't agree with the explanation of 9/11, that much is clear. Is that really a good enough reason to ban an editor? Especially if said blocked editor is trying '''not''' to get involved in controversial articles? It says per [[WP:BLOCKDETERRENT]] that blocks are not justifiable, particularly if the actions have ceased. It also states per [[WP:NNH]] that, \"Expressing unpopular opinions \u2013 even extremely unpopular opinions \u2013 in a non-disruptive manner\" is not a justifiable reason to block an editor per [[WP:!HERE]].

Thanks for that information, as it takes away any faint trace of doubt there might otherwise have been: if after five years you have not improved, you are not likely to suddenly improve if you are blocked now. It is perfectly clear that your purpose here is inconsistent with the aims of Wikipedia.

I have learned from my mistake, and I understand completely why my actions caused me to be banned. Per [[WP:NNH]], it states \"The community encompasses a very wide range of views. A user may believe a communal norm is too narrow or poorly approaches an issue, and take actions internally consistent with that viewpoint, such as advocating particular positions in discussions.

An IP saw \"by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] artist [[Jan van Eyck]]\" and complained loudly that \"Netherlandish\" isn't a word; presumably they thought we wanted \"Dutch\" but we didn't know any better. It's now changed to \"by Jan van Eyck, an Early Netherlandish artist\" (with links). There was discussion at ERRORS that I might be pandering to the IP ... that the proper solution isn't to rewrite it to lose the ambiguity, but to inform the IP that they're wrong and they need to learn what the word means. The problem with that is that, last I heard, we have around 10M hits on the Main Page per day, so we're going to get a wide range of casual readers. I hope most Wikipedians are aware that most readers don't click on most links most of the time ... links are handy if people want to click on them, but for most readers, they don't resolve ambiguities in the text. The link plus the capital \"E\" should have been a clue that \"Early Netherlandish\" meant something different from \"early Netherlandish\" ... but again, most people don't pick up clues from capitalization most of the time. In ''[[The Sense of Style]]'' (p. 36, hardcover), Steven Pinker says that good writing makes readers feel smart and bad writing makes them feel stupid. I'd prefer that as many readers of TFAs as possible catch our meaning on the first read-through. This philosophy is what propels many of the edits I make at TFA, so if I'm on the wrong track, I want to know. Thoughts? - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 13:40, 8 September 2015 (UTC)\n"

If the reader has peripherally skimmed ahead and already knows by the time they get to \"located\" that there's only one prepositional phrase left (of eight words) in the sentence, then \"located\" adds very little; for this reader, I'd delete it. But most readers most of the time don't know when they're only eight words and one prepositional phrase away from the end of the sentence, and for these readers, at the moment when they reach \"located\", the word might help avoid two [[garden path]]s, that is, plausible but incorrect parses, parses that turn out to be wrong by the time you get to the end of the sentence. One bad parse would be to\n",
                        "anticipate that \"Ancestral Puebloan great house and American archeological site in Chaco Culture National Historical Park, New Mexico\" is just the start of the sentence, that the real payload is coming after that; that's a reasonable expectation for the first sentence in an encyclopedia article. The second bad parse would be to assume that \"in\" refers to \"American archeological site\" rather than a compound subject. \"located\" effectly undercuts both of those bad parses. Another reason to favor \"located\" is the length of this sentence; although the human brain is a formidable computer in many respects, our [[working memory#Capacity|working memory is pea-sized]], with only three to five slots. So our puny reading brains can be overtaxed by intricate enyclopedia articles, such as one that starts out: \"Chetro Ketl is an Ancestral Puebloan great house and American archeological site\". The more demanding the text, the less likely it is that a copyeditor will object to signposting, words that don't add a lot of meaning but help to indicate what direction the sentence is headed in. - Dank ([[User talk:Dank|push to talk]]) 16:13, 22 September 2015 (UTC)\n"

I really do have 1,000+ followers on Twitter, and by going to my Twitter account you can see that. But, that doesn't make me popular or notable. Plenty of people have a ton of followers on Twitter, Myspace, YouTube, and that doesn't make them famous. Frankly, I'd remove all of those numbers. There really isn't anything \"encyclopedic\" about it. No one is going to read those numbers and go \"oh, I see, that is very important and valuable to learning about what this person has done.\"\n",

First, if you feel like perusing suggestions on what a reliable source is, you can find it at length [[Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources|here]]. Basically articles without sources listed there won't make it on Wikipedia - so think about things like newspapers or magazines (not Volt itself) that have written about the magazine. So, for the magazine to be considered \"notable\" enough for inclusion it has to meet one of these [[Wikipedia:Notability_(media)#Newspapers.2C_magazines_and_journals|guidelines]]:\n",
                        "#have produced [[:Category:Journalism awards|award winning]] work\n",
                        "#have served some sort of historic purpose or have a significant history\n",
                        "#are considered by reliable sources to be authoritative in their subject area\n",
                        "#are frequently cited by other reliable sources\n",
                        "#are significant publications in ethnic and other non-trivial niche markets\n",
                        "\n",
                        "\"Publications that primarily carry advertising, and only have trivial content, may have relevant details merged to an article on their publisher (if notable).\" Here are some examples of where you can pull material: [http://ftape.com/media/?p=1878][http://www.vvvintage.com/2012/03/06/vvv-with-volt-magazine/][http://fashionbombdaily.com/2012/01/09/snapshot-betty-adewole-by-sean-gleason-for-volt-cafe-magazine/][http://www.refinery29.com/caption-this-anais-poliot-in-volt-magazine-by-emma-tempestl][http://trendland.com/artwear-by-frederik-lieberath/#][http://styleblazer.com/27569/striking-new-face-betty-adewole-models-avant-garde-threads-for-volt-cafe-magazine-fashion-must-see/] I'm not sure if these are going to help or not, but, perhaps its a start!

No instructions or suggestions were placed on the talk page.  (Indeed, no talk page has been created.)  Nonetheless, after the page received the \"cleanup\" notice, I: (1) added section headings and a table of contents; (2) bundled the citations to make the text more readable and eliminate clutter per Wikipedia:Citing sources#Bundling citations; (3) added the official website; (4) added citations in support; (5) added the most recent news from February 2012; and (6) generally tried to cleanup the article.

Along the way, you learn what [[Wikipedia:Vandalism#Types of vandalism|is]] and [[Wikipedia:Vandalism#What is not vandalism|isn't]] vandalism. After you spent time with that, you can enable an automatic program to help you reverting vandalism more quickly, like [[Wikipedia:Twinkle|Twinkle]] or [[User:Ale jrb/Scripts/igloo|Igloo]]. After that, you can [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Rollback|request]] the [[Wikipedia:Rollback feature|rollback feature]] for even faster vandalism reversing.

My proposal is to split off the American portion of the article to be included under category : government and ballots and voting.  Anything else, like in the article, is superfluous.  By this I mean, the article should not be discussing, outlining non-government topics, like private corps or non-profits, or commercial products or what might have been in Russia.  The non-american bits of information should be moved to a new page category : Europe, politics, government.  I'll volunteer to help edit or move or whatever Wiki may decide.

If that doesn't satisfy you, the place to propose a split is the article's Talk page (please remember to sign your posts using four tildes. '''DO NOT''' put tildes on your edits to '''articles''' -- be sure to put an actual [[WP:EDITSUMMARY]] there.). However, since the article is only 27,000 bytes long, it's probably too short to split and doing so would probably result in an undue [[WP:CONTENTFORK]]. In terms of citations, Wikipedia cannot be used as a reference on itself -- references must be outside, independent, reliable sources. In terms of the pipe symbol ('''|'''), it's on the same key as the backslash (use the shift key). To import images, you'd need to download the image onto your own computer and then use the \"Upload file\" link on the left of any page. However, since only copyright-free images can be used on Wikipedia (with only a few exceptions e.g. infoboxes for films, books, albums), and since 99% of images on the internet are copyrighted, it's best to use only images that you have created yourself. There is various information on the subject on pages like [[WP:IUP]] and [[WP:IMAGES]] and the pages in the See Also sections of those articles. Lastly, if you need help on any matter, type <nowiki>{{help}}</nowiki> on your own Talk page and describe what the question is.

I've linked to Duotrope, one of the most trusted names in literary journals, showing the magazine is registered and engaged. I've linked to the author pages showing the journal has published significant writers. I've provided a link showing the magazine has published at least one award winning piece as well as participated in community events.

                                ":Hi, sorry your question appears to have been overlooked for a couple of days. The basic notability criteria for web content is at [[Wikipedia:Notability (web)]] and I think the problem with the article on Switchback is that there aren't reliable independent sources about the website.  You have four references; #1 is a directory saying that the site exists (it's existence isn't an issue) #2 is from the website itself so isn't independent, #3 is more about someone who has contributed to the site and won an award more than about the website itself and #4 is about another event that the site has been involved with.  So, currently, nothing about why the website is notable.  If, for example, the site has won any well known or independent awards then it wouldn't be an issue but as it stands it's \"just another\" website dedicated to poetry and literature.  Are there any reviews in reliable publications e.g. Duotrope, about Switchback for example the quality of the writing or it's style that could be referred to?  Is it the oldest web based journal of it's type? Something like that can be used to prove notability. Sorry I can't be more helpful but it's that type of \"wow\" factor you should try and find.

Encyclopedias don't publish original research; they're strictly tertiary sources.  The problem with original research is that, on Wikipedia, we have no way of knowing if what someone posts is true, or even who really posted it.  We can't do peer-reviews to ensure accuracy, and we can't look at people's credentials to see if we can trust them.  And if we, the editors, can't trust someone, then a reader ''certainly'' can't trust someone.  At the end of the day, our information can *only* be as good as the [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] that back it up, because that's the *only* way we can ensure some standard of reliability (and even then, it doesn't work as well as we like).  As you correctly say, with original research, there will be no coverage in other sources, and that's precisely why we ''cannot'' include it in Wikipedia.\n",

What you do is: the first time you cite something that you're going to cite again, you put a name in the ref tag like so: <code><nowiki><ref name=\"tv\">{{cite whatever}}</ref></nowiki></code> instead of just <code><nowiki><ref>{{cite whatever}}</ref></nowiki></code>.  After that, any time you want to cite the same source again, you'd just write <code><nowiki><ref name=\"tv\"/></nowiki></code> instead of doing the whole reference info all over again.  It's quicker, and it cuts out all the duplicate entries in the reflist at the bottom of the article. Hope this helps!

If that's it then say so - phrases like \"designs, develops and sells consumer electronic products for retailers and distributors both in the local and international market\" and \"The strategy was to offer retailers the option to stock products in one of E3 Style\u2019s registered brands or under the retailer\u2019s own label\" and \"Today, E3 Style is a multi-million dollar company\" sounds like marketing speak and doesn't actually tell the reader anything.  I know plain and simple might sound boring but at least it's plain English and is more understandable at first read.  The opening paragraph (the lede) says they have a large turnover you don't need to gloss it up later, stick to facts.  I think you also need to reduce the reliance on a) naming brands they have franchises for, a representative sample is fine but not all and b) awards - these are good especially if the awards themselves are notable but regional trade awards might be considered window dressing.  As Garamond Lethe has suggested, read the notability guidelines especially those for companies ([[WP:CORP]]) and check that what you are writing meets those guidelines.

On the other hand, there is a tangentially related topic that I would also like to mention.  I think that the original poster approached the repeated declines of his article with a non-collaborative attitude, coming to my talk page and demanding to speak to my supervisor and complaining about rude treatment, after having ignored our comments, preferring to seek advice from professors and then use them for an argument from authority.  If an editor comes to Wikipedia to participate in Wikipedia as an electronic workplace, they will do well to work collaboratively with other editors.  Editors who treat other editors with respect are likely also to be treated with respect, while editors who show that they do not want to listen often are not listened to, or acquire reputations as difficult editors.  I would like to know whether other editors agree that Aagreeny4 started off with a non-collaborative attitude.  I would ask AAgreeny4 to consider how their tone of discourse (and habit of ignoring suggestions) is likely to be received.

I have gone to their talk page and asked for advice, suggestions, and help or to clarify any questions I had. I have taken all of their advice except for one reviewer, who I thought contradicted others suggestion and advice. Each draft has changed significantly since the original. I have rephrased my wording, added many sources, cut out many of the primary sources, added more secondary notably sources, cut out more primary sources, and finally i trimmed down each section of the article almost in half. Can you tell me how any of this is not showing improvement, ignoring comments, and not collaborative? Also I tried the wikilinks, which are a type of citing I have never seen before. I made one small error that you keep fixating on, a simple mistake not putting in 2 brackets and only using one. You should have just stated it was wrong and how to correct it instead of insulting me and my writing by stating \"you don't review why you are submitting\". I would assume this mistake is common for new users. I feel you have not reviewed all my drafts and the changes I have made from each draft submitted, and how much of a change there has been from the beginning to this latest draft. Your comments to me have been rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional. If you want to talk about tone of discourse, I think you should look at yourself also. You have insulted me, my writing, and my college. That is the reason  that I asked to speak to your supervisor. I have called Jimmy Whales and left a message and am waiting to talk to him about you. I also asked you a question on your educational background, which you ignored. Can you answer that question? And it does have bearing on the article, if you are going to make these comments and the way you make them I want to know your credibility to make them. Additionally you wanted to talk about conflict of interest. I think you have a conflict of interest with my article and should excuse yourself from commenting or reviewing my article, because each time someone has commented on this talk page stating they don't think it should be nominated for deletion, you come back and attack me. They make other suggestions and are willing to help with article and sources, you again tell them not to do this and attack me.

I don't know your reasoning, but it is clear in the way you have negatively commented, negate what others are saying, constantly try to offend me, and treat me rudely. Involvement is closely related to conflict of interest, as shown by the Wikipedia definition. \"This is because involved administrators may have, or may be seen as having, a conflict of interest in disputes they have been a party to or have strong feelings about. Involvement is generally construed very broadly by the community, to include current or past conflicts with an editor (or editors), and disputes on topics, regardless of the nature, age, or outcome of the dispute\". Saying that these are not personal attacks are wrong. Saying \"do you even read your articles before submitting\", claiming that I am lazy, or dumb. Fixating on my bracket error. Creating a section on my tone of discourse, that I am non-collaborative, again attacking me. Being at a college I know how to collaborate and work with others, taking their advice, which I have also done here and on my page. You stated \"Editors who treat other editors with respect are likely also to be treated with respect\", I have never felt respect from you whatsoever. You also attacked my school by saying that those helping with the article probably have not written this type and don't know anything. Finally you keep claiming that I won't help myself. Another attack on me, I have asked numerous users for help and take everything they say into consideration and use in my article. I have revised many times, and am constantly working on the paper, and always welcome others input that is said respectfully. Finally I am trying to enhance Wikipedia with this article. How do you know that I am a single-person account? You have no proof. I will work on other articles after this one is accepted.\n",

There are several problems with the draft.  One of them is the sources.  Another is the cruft (such as the Awards section).  Another is the (recently introduced) need for copy-editing of malformed links (introduced because the original poster apparently didn't view the revised draft after adding the malformed links).  As a result, the real question is whether we, the Teahouse volunteers, should essentially write a new article, because that is essentially what we have to do, since the original poster isn't responding to advice.  I thank anyone who is willing to write the new article, but that is beyond the call of duty.

                                ":Hello, {{U|Spiffiest}}, and welcome to the Teahouse. There are several issues here. Foremost, it is not clear from the source you have been trying to introduce to [[Blue Lantern Corps]] that the comic strip published under the Dan Hatem byline in 1980 dealt with the same Blue Lantern Corps that is a [[DC Comics]] property; since only a small preview of the page is shown, it's impossible to determine whether the same organization was depicted as in the later DC Comics publications, or if it is a mere coincidence of name. (If it is the same organization, then Dan Hatem \u2014 who may or may not be you; we have no way of knowing \u2014 may have violated DC Comics [[trademark]]s, which are distinct from copyright, in creating the strip.) Another issue is that ''Boston Heights'' newspaper, as a college rather than a community newspaper, may not be considered a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] for Wikipedia sourcing. Even if it was, the link in question is to the comic strip itself, which makes it a [[WP:PRIMARY|primary source]], and for any information which may be contentious, Wikipedia generally requires secondary sourcing \u2014 something like an article in an independent newspaper or magazine, or a chapter in a book, stating that ''Blue Lantern'' was first published in 1980. So while the actual proof of publication may be of the utmost value in proving a claim as to who originated character(s) in a legal setting, on Wikipedia, it's pretty much beside the point. I hope this clarifies the situation for you.

Your reference to require a secondary source is patently absurd as even DC comics published once and is done for characters. Their own reference does not make the reference any more valuable for historic references. Both DC publication and the Heights are referenced in the Library of Congress, so publications both have secondary sources unlike high school papers. IT IS this reference you yourself seem to think makes it inclusive to Wikipaedea. For this reason there should be an inclusion of this character and timeline as the sources are supported for both and origination as stated as the earlier date referenced. Not every book is referenced by its source and even the Bible that has been republished almost an uncountable amount of times does not require the original author to be referenced by a secondary source. I consider your guide like the Overstreet guide as a reference to only commercial publications but not all publications of character or storyline.

'''[[WP:PRIMARY|Requiring a secondary source]]''' is not \"patently absurd\"; it's how things are done at Wikipedia. Whether a periodical is referenced by the Library of Congress is also not a deciding factor as to whether it is considered '''[[WP:RS|a reliable source as Wikipedia defines that term]]'''. (Tangentially, the Bible was a poor choice of example, since in fact the vast majority of its authors are agreed to be not merely unknown but unidentifiable.) You're free to hold any opinion you like, but the information you want included in the [[Blue Lantern Corps]] article ''will'' continue to be removed by other editors unless and until you provide a source that is both reliable and secondary by Wikipedia's definitions of those terms \u2014 I bolded the links to the relevant policies this time in the hope that you would read them. There is no amount of arguing with me or anyone else that is going to change these policies, so I recommend you study them, and either find an appropriate source to use on this site, or take the source you have elsewhere. Another policy you might benefit by perusing states that '''[[WP:RGW|\"You might think that [Wikipedia] is a ''great'' place to set the record straight and Right Great Wrongs, but that's not the case.\"]]''' I'm sorry if this is disappointing, but I would be doing you no favors to hold out false hope. \u2014[[User:GrammarFascist|<span style=\"color:green;;;\"><b>Grammar</b>Fascist</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/GrammarFascist|<span style=\"color:darkgreen;;;\"><sub>contribs</sub></span>]][[User talk:GrammarFascist|<sup>talk</sup>]] 05:40, 24 November 2015 (UTC)\n"

I think you are also misunderstanding what constitutes an acceptable reference. For example, \"Heights Boston College 1980\", which you inserted as a citation in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blue_Lantern_Corps&diff=691272908&oldid=691272823 this edit] is not an acceptable source, as a) it is not a publication, and b) does not give such details as volume, number or date of publication, nor any author. Wikipedia is not the place to do [[WP:OR|original research]] which includes analysis of conflicting sources. Instead, we cite [[WP:SECONDARY|secondary sources]] who have already done such analysis, and who are not directly connected with the topics being written about. This helps provide a level of objectivity and distance (although it is surely true that some secondary sources are biased). Wikipedia only uses [[WP:PRIMARY|primary sources]] with care and for limited purposes, and not to support controversial or contested statements. The demand for secondary sources is made on every article on Wikipedia, this article is not being singled out.\n",

This is a somewhat extraordinary claim, and thus requires extraordinary evidence. At a minimum, we would need a critical review or analysis published in a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] that is [[WP:IS|independent]] of the creators of the comic, saying both that a comic by the name of \"Blue Lantern\" had been published at that time and place, and that the characters or content was recognizably the same or similar to the later  DC publication. It is especially that last conclusion that Wikipedia must not draw without a source. It is not for you or I or any editor here to decide that the earlier comic is the same as the later, better known, DC publication; even if we had the entire run in front of us. We need a published reliable source that says so, and a proper citation to that source.\n",

Just because you didn't like all of the responses you received doesn't mean there wasn't any appropriate response, and characterizing what happened there the way you have done here does make ''you'' look somewhat unreasonable. I can see I'm not the first to suggest you reconsider your own approach. Hopefully my advice in that regard will not be in vain. \u2014[[User:GrammarFascist|<span style=\"color:green;;;\"><b>Grammar</b>Fascist</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/GrammarFascist|<span style=\"color:darkgreen;;;\"><sub>contribs</sub></span>]][[User talk:GrammarFascist|<sup>talk</sup>]] 14:27, 24 November 2015 (UTC)\n"

Can anyone not ask what are methods for addressing bullying behaviors without getting ulterior motives imputed as you just did right here? And you think that someone who has a bullying history toward me saying simply \"Dunning-Kruger effect\" is not bullying? It's an insult that says \"You are too stupid to know you are stupid.\" Yes, dark motives ''were'' imputed. I asked how i might address bullying behaviors and i get a long diatribe that i am probably \"forum shopping\" and such things. I was seriously asking for how to address bullying behaviors and i got the opposite to a good answer. I got \"Go home you good for nothing stupid devious jerk!\" in so many words! The editor who closed the WP:AN discussion did so wrongly, because i had *not* moved it to another forum. I had posted an ''idea'' at another forum for an anti-bullying task force, in part because of the very bad response i got at WP:AN that made me ask \"where can one go to address these behaviors?\" All of what you wrote, do you really believe it to be true? Are you really not able to hear me honestly? You again are saying that i am unreasonable for asking how one can address bullying behaviors in Wikipedia. When i do so, i get more bullying behaviors. In fact it seems like people take it as an invitation to pummel upon the person who asks. I say '''ENOUGH!!!''' There is a breaking point and this is '''ENOUGH!!!!''' This is a toxic editing environment and there is nowhere anyone can go for remedy to bullying! This is a very real problem. I have seen good editors say things like \"I don't even edit in that topic area anymore because of the toxic editing environment.\" Just yesterday, i stood up for one user who was being seriously railroaded by a bunch of people and made to grovel, when their editing was actually friendly and good when i looked into it. It was a kangaroo court, and this user who was doing good work was about to leave Wikipedia for good. It was a new user being bullied and misrepresented and ganged up on by admins and editors, and blocked, and then made to grovel to be unblocked... it was NOT good. I stood up for that user and they said \"I was about to leave Wikipedia altogether, but you gave me hope that it may be worth it.\" That is the sort of advocate that some people need. Someone who will stand up against ganging-up bullying behaviors. [[User:SageRad|SageRad]] ([[User talk:SageRad|talk]]) 14:37, 24 November 2015 (UTC)\n"

You either weren't asking for admin action, and didn't supply diffs, which are the basis for admin action, or you were asking the community at AN to override the ArbCom.  If you had a complaint about being bullied about genetically modified organisms, the proper venue was ArbCom.  You didn't enter any evidence at ArbCom.  You did go to a reasonable place to [[WP:VPI|Village pump (idea lab)]].  However, you weren't in the right place  You haven't provided concrete evidence that you were bullied, and you haven't provided concrete evidence of anyone else bullying anyone.  We are aware that sometimes there is bullying in Wikipedia.  In my opinion, many complaints of bullying are unfounded, but those that are substantive are usually based on [[WP:OWN|article ownership]] behavior.  You weren't in the right place.

If i had posted about a specific incident, then i would have gone to ANI and would be correct according to this explanation here. Let me refute '''again''' (for i have already refuted and you either didn't hear or chose not to listen) some things you say in error above. I saw '''not''' asking the AN community to override ArbCom. Not at all. I find that suggestion to be derogatory especially after i have clarified over a the AN discussion already. I never said that my question related to genetically modified organisms. I did ''not'' in my question to AN about general methods provide evidence of bullying, because i was asking a question about '''procedure''' and '''methods''' in general. Did you not get that? I believe that AN was a very reasonable place to ask about what methods exist to deal with these behaviors. You imply that it's not. I think you're actually in a bullying mode right here and now, and you were also in a bullying mode in your response to me at AN. Why are you being so pushy, so hostile, so oppositional, so derogatory, and so accusatory to me? Was i not in the right place to ask about methods and procedures within Wikipedia?

This reminds me of a school assignment where we were all asked to locate and critique sources of information about various subjects/incidents. There came in the assignment a particular subject that was five sentences long in another work. When asked what was the best available work on \"X\", what is your answer. We all made mention of the existence of the work in question but no one said it was the then best available so we all got zeros when all we had to do to pass was say \"X\" is the best available work although it is only five sentences long. Not every subject can stand alone as a complete article but certainly there should be every opportunity taken to at least make mention in a article on a wider scale than a subject specific article. WP will never be perfect and to exclude something on the basis that by doing so makes WP more perfect is basically giving credence to an action that in short-sided. The worst thing you can do to understanding a subject is skewing the content.

If there are such sources, then an article could be created, but whether to do so is a matter of editorial judgement and, ultimately, community consensus. If there is not much to say on a topic, or what there is to say is better included as part of another article (here [[Dot Cotton]]) then there is no requirement to create the article, but there is no rule against it, either. It could be discussed on [[Talk:Dot Cotton]], or on the talk page of the redirect. That one editor converted a stub into a redirect need not be the final outcome. An article was [[WP:BOLD|boldly]] created, another editor has converted it to a redir, in effect reverting the creation, and now, in accord with the [[WP:BRD|Bold, Revert, Discuss]] cycle, it is time to discuss the matter among interested editors. All Wikipedia articles (and other pages) are always works in progress, and whether to change an existing one or create a new one should pretty much always be open when such action seems appropriate. One method that is often followed would be to add sourced content to the existing article (here [[Dot Cotton]]) until there is enough that a [[WP:SPLIT|split]] seems like a good idea, and a useful spin-off article can be created.

The main difference is that [[JavaScript]] is considered a security risk and [[lua (programming language)|Lua]] is not. Lua can be run from any page and is limited in scope to allow it to manipulate the page, but not manipulate the host in any way. JavaScript on the other hand has the potential to be used maliciously to gather information about the host and host's machine that can be sent anywhere. I hope this helps answer your question, although it is not as thorough as I would like it to be, I have to run off to class. Please, feel free to ask for clarification if there is something specific I can help with. Happy editing!

                                ":FGuearino, I can give you a run-down on why Lua was chosen instead of Javascript. The development team was looking for a way to add more flexibility to the template system in a way that ordinary editors could contribute to. In particular, the citation template was very complicated and was being run multiple times every time a WP article was downloaded, which adds up to an awful lot. Because the template syntax is limited, editors were having to jump through a lot of hoops to add complex features. That rapidly increases the complexity of the code. The important thing to keep in mind here is that the template code runs on the server, not in the web browser. Javascript is king in web development because it is standardized and included on nearly all web browsers. JS can also be used for server-side development, but in this case there were some specific requirements that made it unsuitable. Most importantly, the developers wanted to allow ordinary users to make changes to the server-side code so they could make better templates. Without setting restrictions on CPU time and memory usage, a user could write a malicious script that would reduce the performance of the Wikimedia servers or crash them completely. That would be very bad. Lua included the capability to set those restrictions out of the box. Restrictions could have been added to Javascript, but it was a much more complex project to add them to the interpreter and doing so would have eliminated many of the performance benefits. The developers were also impressed by some of the Lua integrations they saw, particularly World of Warcraft and Celestia. If you'd like to try it out, start with the [[mw:Lua/Tutorial|tutorial]]. There is also a [[mw:Lua scripting|Lua project page]] with more documentation including a reference manual.

                                ":('''e/c''') Hi Pyrodefect. I edit conflicted with the user above and would just note that I think that post is quite inappropriate and hostile and hope you will ignore it. Anyway, what follows is what I wrote before that edit conflict.<p>There's a misunderstanding here but it's easily made because it's not intuitive. You certainly have the right, as a copyright owner, to provide permission for others to use your copyrighted material, but this does not mean the material's retention of copyright is compatible with the place you wish to give permission for its use. Material at Wikipedia ''must bear a free copyright license that allows our end users to reuse it'' (even for commercial purposes). This means that what we need is not permission for our use, but release of the copyright under our licenses (or ones more permissive).  The content you posted remains fully-copyrighted, with your copyright notice displayed at the bottom of the page (though without any notice we assume content is fully-copyright unless proven otherwise). The only way we could use the content here is if you release it, and that release is done in a manner that provides good evidence of your actual ownership (while I do believe you, we can't just take anyone's anonymous word for it). For that reason, we would require, for example, that you post on the external website a notice releasing the content (you would replace \"\u00a9 2013 illrecur, [name redacted]\", with a \"copyleft\" notice, such as:<blockquote>The text of this website is available for modification and reuse under the terms of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License] and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License GNU Free Documentation License] (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts).</blockquote>Another way to release the copyright is to send an email from an address associated with the domain name of the website, following the form at [[Wikipedia:Declaration of consent for all enquiries]]. Both of these methods provide evidence that you actually have permission for the release we need. See [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]] for more information.<p>Doing this, though, would only take care of the copyright issue. The other issue is notability, as you referred to in your post. Please understand that [[WP:N|notability]], as we use that word here, is not the dictionary definition, and it's not about elitism either, but about keeping this an encyclopedia and not some other type of thing. Encyclopedia articles are by definition [[tertiary source]]s, reporting knowledge about subjects that the world has already taken ''note of'' by publishing substantive material about the topic in [[WP:IRS|reliable sources]] that are independent of the topic, e.g., newspaper articles, books, magazine articles, etc. (not press releases, Facebook, a person's website, blogs and so on). Wikipedia never announces [[WP:OR|new things]], not already reported by the world. Thus, in order to show notability, you must [[WP:REFB|cite]] to those reliable sources discussing you in detail to show both that the ''topic'' is worthy of inclusion and that the sources exist to [[WP:V|verify]] the ''information'' in the article. The simple fact is that most people on the Earth are worthy and unique but not the proper subject of an encyclopedia article; you may be but would need to meet our requirements to show that. Finally, please see  [[Wikipedia:Autobiography]], relevant here. Best regards--[[User:Fuhghettaboutit|Fuhghettaboutit]] ([[User talk:Fuhghettaboutit|talk]]) 02:17, 19 September 2013 (UTC)\n"

As an [[Asperger's Syndrome|Aspie]], I tend to have a heightened sense of right and wrong, and of fairness, so I was interested to see how this would play out in such an example as the \"Onverse\" issue. Your suggestion that someone should ''\"trawl though all those redlinks on [[List of Macintosh games]] and de-link a whole bunch of them\"'' seems like a lot of work, as you implied above.

This is an encyclopedia, not an indiscriminate collection of information.

We remove copyright violations immediately when they are discovered, and this is non-negotiable. Our [[WP:NOTABILITY|notability guidelines]], including the [[WP:GNG|General notability guideline]] and a wide range of subject specific guidelines, are essential tools for evaluating articles.

As I said in my introduction on the Teahouse, I have plenty of technical experience with wiki's, but I'm a n00b when it comes to the culture and community here on Wikipedia, so I am seeking insights like yours above to help me understand more of what it means to be a \"Wikipedian\". I guess the concern I had with what I saw in the \"Onverse\" issue was that it seemed to single out a particular game from the list and place a value on its worth as an article on Wikipedia, which seemed kind of subjective to me. Especially considering the number of similar games in the [[List_of_Macintosh_games|list]] which might also fail the test of \"[[WP:GNG|notability]]\", yet which still remain, un-altered, un-deleted. Shouldn't such AfD procedures take into consideration the pages that link from / to such an article that is intended for deletion? Had the people reviewing the \"Onverse\" AfD looked at that [[List_of_Macintosh_games|list]], or [[Virtual_world#Social|similar]] [[There_(virtual_world)#Competitors|pages]], it would surely have been clear that the \"Onverse\" page is no more or less deserving of deletion than any of its competitors, would it not? I'm not pushing for a review of this decision or anything, I'm just trying to understand it, as a way of understanding Wikipedia culture. <span title=\"Meta-Wiki profile\" class=\"plainlinks\">[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:AugurNZ <font color=\"#000\" face=\"Times\">'''''Augur'''''</font><font color=\"#33f\" family=\"Arial\">'''''NZ'''''</font>]</span> <span title=\"Meta-Wiki talk\" class=\"plainlinks\">[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:AugurNZ <font color=\"#000\" size=\"4\">&#x2710;</font>]</span>[[Special:Contributions/AugurNZ|<font size=\"4\" color=\"#000\">&#x2315;</font>]] 03:46, 18 September 2013 (UTC)\n"

We could leave the article as a stub, but without any guarantee that sources will be found in the future, it's usually considered better to delete rather than risk a perpetual stub.

Take, for instance, [[New Centurions]] which is also on the same [[List_of_Macintosh_games|list of Machintosh games]] as \"Onverse\" was linked from, but it hasn't been edited since 2010, and has no references at all. I'm sure if I went through that list thoroughly I'd find plenty more examples.

Even if someone was a keen taboccoo fan this looked designed to make people looking at individual edits think twice about reverting.

Most importantly, there were no further edits after a first warning was given so no basis to block at all. Had they continued, and ignored warnings, only then. But the warning itself, a final warning for blatant vandalism, was in my view problematic because these were not obviously bad faith edits\u2014this was not a user egregiously promoting one brand or spamming some commercial website but just adding links to various brand names\u2014and, in fact some would argue the links added were actually fine and belong (see [[MOS:DABRL]]). I'm not sure I agree with the idea we should have unlinked or red-linked items on DAB pages at all, but in any event, I don't think these should all have stand-alone articles, so I would have reverted also (but without using [[WP:ROLLBACK|rollback]] or the nuke option, which are only for patent vandalism) and left a tailored message.

First of all, the edits are accurate. These are actual tobacco brand names, at least the five I checked on Google. Secondly, the IP editor has been adding the brand names to [[Chewing tobacco]] and [[Dipping tobacco]], specifically to lists of brand names of these products that have been here for a very long time. In that sense, they are complying with working consensus that we ought to have lists of such tobacco brand names, and improving the encyclopedia in the process.

In the block tool interface we list a bunch of different flavors of those two basic violations.  Why then do we need to list \"NotHere\", which is less specific than either of the two basic reasons to block?  Let's be specific.

The only other information page that admins should(?) use for a block rationale [[MediaWiki:Ipbreason-dropdown|here]] appears to be [[WP:VOA|VOA]], which is directly tied to a policy. All other rationales are either guidelines or policy. NOTHERE starts out with ''\"A major pillar of Wikipedia is that editors are here purely to build an encyclopedia\"''. So... what \"major pillar\" is that?! It doesn't even make sense, which is why it is not policy.\n",

In many situations, I regard that as more helpful than just saying \"You are blocked because you are not here to contribute to the encyclopaedia\", unless prior existing context makes it clear what the more detailed reason is. That is exactly analogous to what applies in the case of most other block reasons: \"You have been blocked for edit-warring on such and such an article in such and such circumstances\" is better than just \"You have been blocked for edit-warring\", unless previous messages make the details unambiguous already. However, frequently the essential reason for a block is that the editor's purpose here is something other than contributing to the encyclopaedia. Typically, an editor comes here for some unsuitable purpose (such as using Wikipedia to publish his or her own made-up fictitious country, or using a user page as a blog), he or she is politely told that doing so is not what Wikipedia is for, he or she persists, is told again more firmly, persists again, and is then blocked. It seems to me that in such a situation he or she is being blocked substantially because he or she is here not to contribute to the encyclopaedia, but rather for some other purpose, and that being so, it makes sense to say so in the block log. Very often, none of the other common reasons quite fits, so if administrators were forbidden to give that as a block reason, granted that a block log rationale has to be fairly short and concise, the result would be that often a less accurate, and possibly misleading, reason, would be given. I don't agree that every blocking rationale needs to link to a policy, but I do agree that in some ways linking to the page [[WP:NOTHERE]] is not ideal. However, whether we should link to that page is a quite separate issue from whether it is reasonable to give \"not being here to contribute to the encyclopaedia\" as a reason for blocking. I agree with [[User:NeilN|NeilN]] that not being here to contribute to the encyclopaedia is a clearer reason than the extremely vague \"disruptive editing\".\n",

Since being here for a purpose other than contributing to the encyclopaedia is frequently the most natural reason for a block, it is therefore reasonable for administrators to block for that reason. Moreover, ''whether people in this discussion agree that it is reasonable or not, it '''''is''''' in fact one of \"the most common rationales for blocks\"'', so it makes sense that it should be included in the list of \"Common rationales for blocks\". We don't have to link to [[WP:NOTHERE]] if consensus is against doing so, and certainly I am far from persuaded that doing so is a good idea. Just adding some wording such as \"Not being here to contribute to the encyclopaedia\", perhaps with a sentence or so clarifying it, would be reasonable. For those who think that every block should refer to a policy, the objection that \"not here to contribute\" is not a policy would then be answered, because it would be included in the blocking policy. <small>''The editor who uses the pseudonym''</small> \"[[User:JamesBWatson|JamesBWatson]]\" ([[User talk:JamesBWatson#top|talk]]) 16:12, 2 November 2015 (UTC)\n"

The \"Not here\" statement is a fine preamble when giving an explanation, but it alone is not sufficient to justify a block.  Words matter.

The practice is that NOTHERE is used as a block rationale a lot, which makes that rationale policy with a small \"p\". The whole  point of a wiki format is that things are fluid, they change over time, and we don't need to waste our time ratifying every minor change in practice. This RfC is a total waste of time, and the question is a non-issue (I use the rationale frequently for trolls, for example). But since we're here: Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia; our purpose as Wikipedians is to write and maintain it. Anything else should go somewhere else, and anyone whose edits don't contribute to that aim should be shown the door. That doesn't mean we have to be arseholes about it, but if somebody shows no interest in anything other than promoting their company/recording grandad's war stories/using Wikipedia as a webhost/re-fighting ancient wars/pushing a nationalist POV/etc etc, and we can't get them to stop voluntarily, they should be blocked and \"NOTHERE\" is as good an explanation for such a block as anything.

(2) Editors keep on harping on about the status of [[WP:NOTHERE]] as \"not a policy\". However, arguing that something should not be accepted because it isn't a policy is nonsense for at least two reasons. Firstly, many thing we do are not policies, and trying to turn Wikipedia into some sort of bureaucracy, where nothing can be done unless sanctioned by a written policy, is not helpful. Secondly, if there is consensus that the current practice is acceptable, then it can be added to the blocking '''POLICY''' if editors want every acceptable practice to be sanctioned by a policy. Arguing that we should not add it to a policy because it isn't policy is pure nonsense. (And, for the benefit of anyone who is unaware of the relevant history, this string of discussions was started because of editors wishing to add it to the blocking policy.) (3) ''\"I cannot accept the fact the admins base their actions on an essay which contains some questionable advice\"''. When did any administrator \"base their actions on\" that page? As far as I am concerned, I block people because it is clear that their editing does more harm than good to the project: if the particular manner in which that manifests itself indicate that they are here for some purpose other than contributing to the encyclopaedia, then it seems to me reasonable to say so; that does not mean that I am \"basing\" the decision to block on the existence of that page.

You no longer have the option of linking to NOTHERE because it doesn't exist. Get it?

So it's \"obvious\" that you can't use \"not here to build an encyclopedia\" as a blocking rationale in that scenario. There is always something more appropriate to link to that is far more important than this essay when blocking. Understand?

Now, please take a look at the very top: According to [[WP:RFC|RfC rules]] (AFAIU), the question was posted '''exactly''' about the contested edit of the policy. Despite the venom in my address from some, my purpose was to keep the discussion focused. While it is good that someone again brought our attention that the question is in fact a multipronged issue, the basic issue IMO remains single: if we are to add a new bullet or section in a ''policy'', it cannot remain ''vague''. (Vague issues of policy belong to [[WP:COMMONSENSE]] & [[WP:IAR]].) IMO we agree that the phrase \"not here to build encyclopedia\" is but a shortcut, a tad longer than \"WP:NOTHERE\", to describe a frolicking behavior with a number of petty violations which, when taken alone each seem insufficient for block. And the real definition of this must be in the appropriate guideline. ''Such a guideline is a must.'' Otherwise one can block 80% of editors in Israel-Palestine topics: An admin can say \"you are here for pushing Jewish agenda and nothing else\", while the person is genuinely convinced he is doing a Good Thing by fixing wikipedia from the recent European surge of anti-Semitism slowly trickling into wikipedia. Therefore, for the purpose of analysis you can split my question (and answers) into as many subcurrents as convenient, the question remains single: '''whether [[WP:NOTHERE]] be officially listed in the policy''', and all ramifications mentioned should be viewed as arguments ''pro'' and ''contra''.

I note that the policy simply gives a list of \"common rationales\" for blocks, and only specifies a limited set of reasons for which ''[[Wikipedia:Blocking policy#When blocking may not be used|blocking may not be used]]''.

A reasonable notice was left on [[User talk:1kdhar]]. I guess my only quibble with this is that I'd rather see something like \"Narrow self interest and/or promotion\" and/or \"Focusing on Wikipedia as a social networking site\" left in the block-log summary. If we could replace the \"not here\" rationale with these other reasons, which are already included by consensus in the information page, then I think that might satisfy most of the opposition here. Now, if anyone thinks editors shouldn't be blocked for social networking, then that needs to be spelled out in the \"When blocking may not be used\" section of the policy.

The argument \"one that is no longer concerned with adding content, maintaining content or other aspect of the site, and is being used henceforth for inciviity, attacking other users, or posting strings of expletives\" is dubious in the part ''\"no longer\"'' How long the \"no longer\" should be? What was the reason of incivility? Was the person provoked that he could not do anything else but vent their frustration? Real people are not machines. Occasional outbursts happen. You do have to block them. Explain the real reason: disruption is intolerable; disagreements must be resolved in civilized way. But don't tell them they are basically a useless piece of shit and kick out forever. Kudpung is entitled to his strong opinion about disruptors and the ways he handles them, but I strongly object that his POV on NOTHERE be ''part of the policy''.

In total there have been 4794 NOTHERE blocks since August 2013 [http://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/6022].

                        "re: ''\"Any good rational whatsoever is fair game when an editor is blocked. There is no need for it to be documented somewhere.\"'' -- Two points: (1) yes a \"good rationale\" is good to have documented, for spread of good practice. (2) If there were infinite number of \"good rationales\", then documenting them all would be impractical. Fortunately this is not the case: People have a nifty thing called \"abstract thinking\" which allows them to classify infinite number phenomena into a finite set of concepts. Example: It is a good rationale: \"I blocked you because you put the word 'penis' and \"gay\" into several articles\". I am sure it is an extremely common editing; I remember reverting some myself. But nobody would suggest to put \"Adding word ''penis'' into an article\" into the policy. In our case of NOTHERE we are dealing with an ''abstract'' definition of a certain editing pattern, which can cover ''a big number'' of concrete behaviors. Therefore in my Book of Logic this is a valid example why NOTHERE deserves to be in the policy, unlike WP:DONT_PUT_PENIS_INTO_RANDOM_ARTICLES.

I would go so far as to suggest that simply another unblock request should be submitted if they don't like the unblock conditions proposed the first time so another admin, familiar with the unblock process, will review and possibly offer a different set of conditions. We usually see multiple unblock requests anyway, so this appeal process will simply undergo that work plus new work at AN. The fundamental problem I've seen is that most people who request an unblock don't believe their unblock was justified in the first place. [[WP:AN]] might not work for technical reasons because they'll have to \"agree\" to the unblock conditions to get unblocked, and only then will be able to edit [[WP:AN]].

It's often a lengthy process because the majority of unblock requests, the editor either fails to understand the unblock process (because they haven't read the relevant policies) or fall into [[WP:IDHT]]. They are after all (but not always) the most problematic and disruptive editors on the project. When an unblock is finally granted, very often the unblocking admin needs to check in on that editor at routine intervals. It's almost like being their case worker. I'm not saying this is the optimal solution, but it's what ends up happening. Admins need to be able to review the circumstances around a block and implement conditions whereby, hopefully, the reason for the initial block is not repeated. I think there could be an expiration time set for conditions, but it would be as open as up to one year. Sometimes admins have to deal with repeat offenders who have 3-6 previous blocks. Also, indefinite blocks would cause the additional problem of an editor having indefinite conditions set upon them. I don't think we should worry about the blocks that are one or two weeks long. If a set of conditions seem unreasonable or the editor is unwilling to agree to them, they can simply wait out the block. We really need to address long term conditions. They need to be able to be implemented and the edit needs to be free of them at a certain point. Lastly, I'm not crazy about the appeal process. We're going to run into [[WP:ADMINSHOP]] which we already experience at [[:Category:Requests for unblock]]. I think if an editor doesn't like the conditions at the time of their request, they should be able to request (up to one time) for another uninvolved admin to review their unblock request. If, for some reason, we end up having the appeal process, it's going to need to be clear that whoever grants the appeal and relieves the editor of their conditions or reduces them, then must adopt the editor. The reason being is that blocking and unblocking admins are often called back to comment on repeat offenders as they're familiar with the \"case\".

But since there were no powers in the world at that time who could, that does not make it a Pyrrhic victory - a victory with so much casualties it would lead to almost certain loss if the ongoing war would continue from the status quo '''after''' the victory. If we redefine Pyrrhic victory to fit the outcome of WWII almost all major wars would have ended in a Pyrrhic victory. E.g. the outcome of the Napoleontic war would also be Pyrrhic (Wellington would not have been able to confront the Grande Armee immediately after Waterloo -- But that was a non-issue as Napoleon already lost that army in his ill-fated Russian campaign). Similarly the French would probably not have been able to withstand the original 1914 German attack in 1918, however the Germans were not able to execute that attack anymore in 1918.\n",

Neither the USSR nor the USA were prepared to fight in the beginning. Both developed their militaries during the war and were stronger in 1945 than they were in 1940. The USSR took vast losses. The USSR's army was stronger at the end than at the beginning. That's not Pyrrhic in the slightest. Yes, Europe lost colonial empires but that took place for decades after the war, due the rise of the new powers that be, and only indirectly due to the war itself. Germany's motivation was to build an empire within Europe, not to simply take over colonies, so that makes it an existential war for Europe, not a colonial one.  Western Europe was then rebuilt under the Marshall Plan, money provided by one of their wartime allies. A Pyrrhic victory means you win the battle but lose the war. Yes, England, the Netherlands, Belgium and France, etc., lost influence and colonies, but they emerged nationally intact, were rebuilt with the assistance of a wartime ally (and were able to build a beneficial international alliance that did not exist pre-war), and were not subsumed into a Thousand Year Reich, so it's a vast stretch of the imagination to say the Allies won the battle and lost the war. Poland could make the argument they won the battle but lost the war, but I'm really not sure any other country could.[[Special:Contributions/71.160.33.132|71.160.33.132]] ([[User talk:71.160.33.132|talk]]) 19:26, 23 September 2015 (UTC)\n"

Unlike them, we went all the way! We played an important part in the Capture of Sevastopol and the overall fighting in the Crimea. When the Romanian 2nd Mountain Division occupied Nalchik in the Caucasus, was the most Eastern point reached by the Axis, at that moment at least. How is that not something major? Or us supplying over a third of the total Axis fuel, how is that not something major? Or us contributing a force larger than all Germany's allies combined, how is that not something major? Or German troops being under nominal Romanian command (the 11th Army under Antonescu as part of Army Group Antonescu at the start of Barbarossa and the 6th Army under Dumitrescu as part of Army Group Dumitrescu from April to August 1944. Check the list of Army Gropus if you don't believe me.). Also out of the 43 foreigners who were awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, 18 were Romanians, and only 8 Italians! That means that our command was much better, at least according to the Germans. There was also the siege of Odessa. The only Soviet Hero City, and one of the original 4, that was captured by mainly a non-German Axis force, another major thing! It is understandable that you did not add France, since France did next to nothing compared to Romania. I dare say that not even Italy did as much as we did, and yet they still got a place among the commanders! It is a common mistake that, in a conflict, more credit to be inherently given to the Great Powers, even if there are non-Great Powers that had a greater impact. Think at Romania in the context of World War 2, not in the general, stereotypical context. I just gave you 6 strong reasons for us to be considered as playing a major role. And that was just scratching the surface. If you don't want to understand, and don't want to put the Romanian leader in his rightful, well deserved place, then I'm sorry, but you're just biased.\n",

Finally, you want to go to the politics huh? Well, after the invasion of Yugoslavia, Hitler wanted to give the Serbian Banat to Hungary. But Antonescu opposed and told Hitler to keep the Hungarian Army out of the Banat. And guess what? Hitler complied! Look, it doesn't matter that Hitler was the ruler of Germany and Antonescu was ruler of Romania. Their relationship was based first and above all on military virtue, and by that virtue, a flimsy Corporal like Hitler must obey a proven General like Antonescu.

The consensus from previous discussions has been to add the most important leader for the major combatants, and I think that's Hirohito. Tojo was certainly significant, but not as much as Hirohito was - especially as he resigned a bit over a year before the end of the conflict.

A lot of the other content added also seems to deal primarily if not exclusively with the idea of Jewishness as well, and the same reservations more or less apply there - that they seem to be criticizing the story on its apparent lack of understanding of Judaism. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think maybe a lot of the possibly real people Eisner used as the basis for his characters might have been comparatively \"devoid of Jewish learning or insight,\" and on that basis the material might accuraately represent them, even if Klingenstein finds it a disappointment.\n",

I might revise the paragraph to start with that material, and then maybe edit down the other material to maybe saying something to the effect that the characters are presented as being what a possibly Jewish scholar? said are \"devoid of Jewish learning and insight,\" with perhaps a few examples. But, again, the story is allegedly more or less autobiographical, and it could well be that the real people used as bases for the characters might not have been particularly well informed Jews themselves for all I know.

There were books that were appearing in the few years before ''Contract'' that were advertised as graphic novels: aside from ''The First Kingdom'' in 1974, in 1976 there were ''[[Bloodstar]]'' and ''[[Chandler: Red Tide]]''.  How \"modern\" is \"modern\"?  Further muddying the waters is the fact the definition of the term \"graphic novel\" has never been set in stone, and in the 21st is getting closer and closer to be a synonym for \"comics\" in general.  What does \"modern graphic novel\" mean in ''that'' context?

Most of what I have on hand is 6 or 8 pin. Original research, but why would there be a good cite that would have average pin counts that would support the claim? It seems very dubious. Obviously in certain applications it would be true, but how would it be true generally for TTL devices? Any TTL device with 14 or more pins is going to contain a large number of components, and those smaller components are probably all available for order as discrete units with less pins, and still in PDIP.

Seems like a reference to the TTL data book, describing hundreds of TTL chips, should be enough to settle the question. I don't think we need a government funded, peer-reviewed study on the number of pins on a chip to know how many there are. I do agree that there are plenty of cases where original research is a problem, when no sources are available to show the difference, and reliable funded, and reviewed studies are needed. I don't believe that this is one of those. In the case of TTL I suspect (uh-oh, original research) that standardizing on 14 and 16 pin packages helped with the economy of scale, and kept prices down.

In this article, most refs are cited once; the only benefit to sfn is the references can be sorted by name rather than cite order; some editors may want to retain that feature, but sorted by footnote number is good enough for me. That is, an easier method is long footnotes that put the CS1 template inside <code>ref</code> tags and invoke {{tl|reflist}} at the bottom of the page; an editor need not edit both inline (sfn/harv) and out-of-line (biblio).
