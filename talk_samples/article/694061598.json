Having said that, I have some reservations about the exact content added. I am not myself sure, for instance, that the phrase \"not a recognizably Jewish story\" really adds much, because, honestly, I'm not sure that anyone ever said it was necessarily a \"Jewish story,\" but maybe just a story about American Jews of a particular era, which isn't quite the same thing. A lot of the other content added also seems to deal primarily if not exclusively with the idea of Jewishness as well, and the same reservations more or less apply there - that they seem to be criticizing the story on its apparent lack of understanding of Judaism. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think maybe a lot of the possibly real people Eisner used as the basis for his characters might have been comparatively \"devoid of Jewish learning or insight,\" and on that basis the material might accuraately represent them, even if Klingenstein finds it a disappointment.\n", "\n", "The idea that Hersh unrealistically struggles with basic Jewish teaching does seem to me to be potentially the most encyclopedic material included, because it is talking about the story itself as a story, rather than as a story from the Jewish perspective. I might revise the paragraph to start with that material, and then maybe edit down the other material to maybe saying something to the effect that the characters are presented as being what a possibly Jewish scholar? said are \"devoid of Jewish learning and insight,\" with perhaps a few examples. But, again, the story is allegedly more or less autobiographical, and it could well be that the real people used as bases for the characters might not have been particularly well informed Jews themselves for all I know.

I think the idea is that Eisner channeled his feelings through Hersh, but the character of Hersh himself was not actually based on Eisner (who was born in the US, and, I get the feeling, was not devoutly Jewish(?) ). <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn nickname\">[[User:Curly Turkey|Curly Turkey]]</span> ([[User talk:Curly Turkey|gobble]])</span> 21:32, 17 March 2013 (UTC)\n"], "comments": [{"text_blocks": ["::I don't know much about Eisner's religious life - I think the editors at the Comics project probably know more.
